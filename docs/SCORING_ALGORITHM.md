# Lead Scoring Algorithm

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This scoring system is based on logical assumptions, not proven conversion data.**

The scores reflect our reasoning about which business characteristics *might* indicate a better fit for AI voice agent services. The point values (+2 for no booking, -1 for chat widget, etc.) are hypotheses about what matters - they are not validated by real sales outcomes.

**The scores help you prioritize, but YOU make the final decision.** Your sales experience and judgment matter more than any algorithm. Use scores as a starting point for investigation, not as recommendations.

To validate this algorithm, you would need to track actual close rates and adjust the scoring based on real results.

## Overview

Lead scoring evaluates businesses based on **detectable signals that logically suggest they might need AI voice agent services** (AI receptionists, booking systems, call handling automation).

**Why Lead Scoring Helps:**
- ⏱️ **Saves Time**: Filter leads by characteristics that suggest pain points
- 🎯 **Better Context**: Understand WHY a lead was flagged before calling
- 🧠 **Logical Prioritization**: Start with businesses showing the most opportunity signals
- 📊 **Signal Detection**: Automated scanning for pain point indicators

**What We Score:**
- Pain points (no online booking, phone issues)
- Business readiness (established vs struggling)
- Technical gaps (outdated website, no SSL)
- Decision-making ability (independent vs franchise)

**⚡ Important Note About Modern Tech:**
Even businesses with modern tech (online booking, chat widgets, responsive sites) can upgrade to AI voice agents for:
- 24/7 availability beyond business hours
- Better phone call handling and routing
- More sophisticated automation
- Cost savings vs human receptionists

**Lower scores don't mean "don't contact"** - they mean fewer detectable pain points. You still decide who to reach out to based on your strategy.

## Scoring Philosophy

### Our Approach: Detect Pain Point Indicators

We're looking for businesses that logically might benefit from AI voice agents based on:
1. **Observable operational gaps** (no booking system, phone complaints in reviews)
2. **Business stability indicators** (reviews, ratings suggest established operation)
3. **Absence of competing solutions** (no chat widgets, no modern automation)
4. **Decision-making structure** (independent vs franchise)

### The Logic Behind the Scoring

**Higher Scores (8-10 points) suggest:**
- Multiple detectable pain points that AI could address
- Reviews mentioning phone accessibility issues
- Manual processes (no online booking)
- Established business with resources to invest
- Independent ownership (faster decision-making)

**Lower Scores (0-3 points) suggest:**
- Few or no detectable pain points
- Already invested in automation (chat widgets, booking systems)
- Franchise structure (limited local autonomy)
- Risk factors (very low ratings)

**Important:** These are logical indicators, not guarantees. A low-scored lead might still buy, and a high-scored lead might say no. Sales is complex - the algorithm just helps you spot patterns.

## How Scoring Works

### Base Score
All leads start at **0 points**

### Signal Detection
Our system analyzes each business for specific signals (data points that indicate opportunity or risk)

### Point Accumulation
- **Positive signals** add points (+1, +2, +3)
- **Negative signals** subtract points (-1)
- **Final score** = sum of all signal points

### Score Range
- Minimum: **0 points** (no opportunity)
- Maximum: **10 points** (perfect opportunity)

---

## Positive Signals (Opportunities)

These signals indicate the business has pain points that AI voice agents can solve.

### 🔥 High-Value Signals (+2 points each)

#### ✅ No Online Booking System
**Points:** +2
**What it means:** Business struggles with appointment management
**Why it matters:** Perfect fit for AI booking assistant. Likely managing appointments manually via phone calls, spreadsheets, or voicemail.
**Pitch angle:** "Your customers can book 24/7 without calling"

**Example:**
- Dental office with no online scheduler
- Yoga studio requiring phone calls to book classes
- Auto repair shop managing appointments via paper calendar

---

#### ✅ Phone Issues in Reviews
**Points:** +2
**What it means:** Customers complain about phone service in Google reviews
**Why it matters:** AI receptionist solves this exact pain point
**Pitch angle:** "I saw customers mention phone difficulties in reviews..."

**Common review phrases:**
- "Couldn't get through on the phone"
- "Always get voicemail"
- "Tried calling 3 times, no answer"
- "Phone always busy"
- "Voicemail box full"

---

### 💡 Medium-Value Signals (+1 point each)

#### ✅ Late Hours Operation
**Points:** +1
**What it means:** Business open early morning or late evening
**Why it matters:** High call volume during extended hours, AI handles overflow
**Pitch angle:** "Never miss a call during your busiest hours"

**Example:**
- Gym open 5am-11pm (peak morning/evening calls)
- Restaurant with late-night service
- 24-hour service business (towing, emergency plumbing)

---

#### ✅ Outdated Website (>3 years old)
**Points:** +1
**What it means:** Website copyright is 3+ years old
**Why it matters:** Indicates business needs tech modernization, likely receptive to automation
**Pitch angle:** "As you modernize your online presence, let's automate your phones too"

**Detection:** Copyright year in footer (e.g., "© 2020 Acme Dental")

---

#### ✅ No SSL Certificate
**Points:** +1
**What it means:** Website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS
**Why it matters:** Security gap indicates low tech investment, opportunity to position as tech advisor
**Pitch angle:** "While you're upgrading security, let's also upgrade your phone system"

**Visual indicator:** Browser shows "Not Secure" warning

---

#### ✅ Not Mobile-Friendly
**Points:** +1
**What it means:** Website doesn't display properly on mobile devices
**Why it matters:** Tech gap indicates business behind on modernization
**Pitch angle:** "Many of your customers call because your site doesn't work on mobile"

**Detection:** No responsive design, requires zooming on mobile

---

#### ✅ High Rating (4.5+ stars)
**Points:** +1
**What it means:** Business has strong Google/Yelp rating
**Why it matters:** Established reputation = easier to sell to, can afford solutions
**Pitch angle:** "Protect your 4.8-star rating by ensuring every call is answered"

**Sweet spot:** 4.5-4.9 stars (excellent but room to improve)

---

#### ✅ High Review Count (100+ reviews)
**Points:** +1
**What it means:** Business has 100+ Google/Yelp reviews
**Why it matters:** Proven track record, high customer volume, can afford solutions
**Pitch angle:** "With 250 reviews, you're clearly busy - let AI handle overflow"

**Correlation:** More reviews = more customers = more inbound calls

---

## Negative Signals (Harder to Sell)

These signals indicate the business may not be a good fit for AI voice agents.

### ⚠️ Red Flags (-1 point each)

#### ❌ Already Has Chat Widget

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I customize the scoring algorithm?
Not currently. The scoring algorithm is optimized for AI voice agent sales based on data from successful deals. Future versions may allow custom weighting.

### How often is scoring updated?
Scores are calculated when leads are first generated (during the search). They don't update automatically unless you re-run the search.

### What if a lead has a low score but I know they're interested?
Scores are guidance, not rules. If you have inside information (referral, personal connection, expressed interest), contact them regardless of score.

### Why did my competitor close a 4/10 scored lead?
Scoring predicts probability, not certainty. A 4/10 lead has ~10-15% close rate vs 30-40% for 8+. Lower scores just mean lower odds, not impossible.

### Can I see the exact scoring formula?
Yes! Click any lead score badge in the leads table to see the full breakdown with point-by-point calculation.

### Does the algorithm learn from my wins/losses?
Not yet. This is a planned feature (Success Tracking). Future versions will adjust scores based on your actual close rates.

### What if I disagree with a signal's point value?
The point values are based on aggregated sales data. If you consistently find a signal doesn't matter for your market, let us know! We refine the algorithm based on user feedback.

### Are negative signals dealbreakers?
No. A lead with a chat widget can still buy (upgrade to voice AI). A franchise might have local decision authority. Negative signals just reduce probability, they don't disqualify.

### How do you detect these signals?
Signals are detected by our n8n automation workflow during lead generation:
- Website scraping (SSL, mobile-friendly, copyright year)
- Google Places API (reviews, rating, hours)
- Review text analysis (phone issues, booking mentions)
- Pattern matching (franchise indicators, chat widgets)

### Can I request new signals?
Yes! If you notice patterns in your successful deals that we don't score for, share them. We continuously improve the algorithm.

### What's the difference between score and "Why Flagged"?
- **Score**: Numerical assessment (0-10) based on all signals
- **Why Flagged**: The PRIMARY reason this lead was surfaced (the strongest pain point)

Example: Lead scores 8/10 with "Why Flagged: No booking + phone issues" means those 2 signals (+4 points combined) are the main opportunity.
